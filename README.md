# Subject Abstract Classes
 
<h3>Context:</h3>
You have been hired as a systems analyst/programmer by a vocational training school. The institution has collaborators who can be either individuals (teachers or instructors with employment contracts) or legal entities (companies that provide training services). The school needs a system to register these collaborators, distinguishing the specific data for each type (individuals and legal entities) but maintaining a general registration structure, such as address, phone number, and email.

Your manager requested that you implement this system using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The idea is to create a flexible and reusable structure that can meet the different needs for registering collaborators.

<h3>Tasks:</h3>
<li>Analyze the Registration Requirements</li>
<li>Design the Inheritance Structure</li>
<li>Implement the Classes in Java</li>
<li>Implement the Main Class to Test the Registration</li>
